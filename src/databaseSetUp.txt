A. Once you get the files into the correct place and set up a database
B. I am using xampp which comes with phpMyAdmin

1. Find the line "mysqli_select_db($con, 'userregistration');" in the verification.php 
and validation.php pages. 

'userregistration' is the name of the database that I am connecting for the purpose of
storing game user's username and password

If you choose to name your database something else you must change 'userregistration'
in the line containing "mysqli_select_db($con, 'userregistration');" to the name of your 
database

2. Steps for database (just in case)

1.) open phpMyAdmin
2.) click on database
3.) In "Create Database" field name database (I named the database'userregistration')
4.) click create
5.) Find database name in the left panel section
6.) Enter the table name as "usertable" and set number of columns to 2 --> click go
7.) In column name section do the following

	row 1: Name -> name | Type -> varchar | Length/Values -> 255 | Index -> Primary (click go)
	row 2: Name -> password | Type -> varchar | Length/Values -> 255
 
8.) Preview sql then click save
9.) you can go to the login.php file and register a user
10.) Registration is successful if you are redirected to the login page
11.) Enter login to login part of page
12.) youll be directed to the home.php page where we can implement the game.



3.) Please dont make any changes to the main branch until we get done with the game
